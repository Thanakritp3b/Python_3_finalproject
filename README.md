This is Final Project in my python-3 class 
# Maze solver Project
This Project for practicing or experiment the maze solving using dfs or bfs 
## Core Function 
- If you don't have a graph you can click generate to generate graph ( If width or Height is even number the wall will be blank )
- format of graph ( S = Start , E = End , # or 1 = wall , 0 or ' ' or * = path)
- only have dfs and bfs algorithm but in the future may be adding more
## Tech Stack
- Next.js (frontend)
- Flask + NexworkX + PIL (backend)
## To get start
1. run python - **must install python first**
```
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install requirements.txt
python app.py
```
2. run frontend - **must install node first**
```
cd ..
cd maze-solver
npm run dev
```
